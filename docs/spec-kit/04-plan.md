# Implementation Plan

## Technology choices

- Language: Python 3.11+
- Web framework: Flask
- Template: HTML file under templates/index.html
- Testing: pytest
- CI/CD: Jenkins declarative pipeline
- Packaging: ZIP archive created by Jenkins

## Architecture

Browser -> Flask route `/` -> render_template("index.html") -> static HTML response

## Files to create

- app.py
- templates/index.html
- tests/test_app.py
- requirements.txt
- Jenkinsfile
- README.md

## Testing strategy

Use Flask test client to call `/` without starting the server manually.
Check status code and important page text.

## Risks

- Python or Flask may not be installed correctly.
- Jenkins agent may not have Python available in PATH.
- Windows and Jenkins shell syntax may differ.

## Risk controls

- Verify Python version before coding.
- Run tests locally before Jenkins.
- Keep Jenkinsfile simple and readable.
