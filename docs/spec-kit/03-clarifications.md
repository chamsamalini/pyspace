# Clarifications

## Questions and decisions

Q1. Should the app be dynamic or static?

Q2. Which Python web framework should be used?
Decision: Flask, because it is simple for learners and suitable for a small web app.

Q3. Should the page use CSS?
Decision: Use simple embedded CSS inside index.html to keep the project small.

Q4. What should be tested?
Decision: Test that the home page returns HTTP 200 and contains the expected SDD content.

Q5. What should Jenkins do?
Decision: Jenkins should install dependencies, run pytest, package the source into a ZIP file, and archive it.

Q6. Is deployment required?
Decision: No. CI pipeline demonstration is enough for this workshop.
